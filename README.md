# History of Boba Tea
## I love drinking boba... why not find out where it comes from? I created this project to share my discovery with others!

- YouTube videos about implementing scroll triggers and parallax features in JavaScript

### Features
- Dynamic scrolling with progress bar
- Small parallax effects across the site
- Navigation links to different sections of the page
- Modern CSS and JS animations for text and images
- An animated timeline summarizing the website
- Historical map-like aesthetic
- Copyright-free images

### What I learned
- How to use scrolling animations, triggers, and a progress bar in JavaScript
- How to make nav links to different parts of a page
- I struggled with conceptually designing a timeline that made sense to a viewer
- I struggled to learn the additional JavaScript animations, but I powered through with tutorial resources

# History of Boba Tea
## I love drinking boba... why not find out where it comes from? I made this project to let others know too!

###Resources
- 
-
-
-
- YouTube videos about implementing scroll triggers and parallax features in JavaScript

###Features
- Dynamic scrolling with progress bar
- Small parallax effects across the site
- Navigation links to different sections of the page
- Modern CSS and JS animations for text and images
- An animated timeline summarizing the website
- Historical map-like aesthetic
- Copyright-free images

###What I learned
- How to use scrolling animations, triggers, and a progress bar in JavaScript
- How to make nav links to different parts of a page
- I struggled with conceptually designing a timeline that made sense to a viewer
- I struggled to learn the additional JavaScript aniamtions, but I powered through with tutorial resources

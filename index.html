            <p>Bubble tea, also called boba tea or pearl milk tea, originated in Taiwan during the 1980s. The exact story is debated, but two tea shops claim to have invented the beverage.</p>
            <p>Chun Shui Tang teahouse in Taichung claims their product manager, Lin Hsiu Hui, created the first bubble tea in 1988 by adding tapioca pearls to her iced tea on a whim.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Hanlin Tea Room in Tainan says they invented it earlier, inspired by white tapioca pearls he saw that reminded them of pearls.</p>

            <p>Throughout the 1990s, bubble tea evolved. What started as a simple milk tea with tapioca pearls expanded to a bunch of variations.</p>
            <p>Tea shops experimented with different tea bases, from traditional black and green teas to oolong and jasmine. Fruit flavors were introduced, creating refreshing alternatives to the original milk tea.</p>
            <p>The tapioca pearls themselves underwent innovation, with different sizes, colors, and even flavors being developed. Some shops introduced popping boba, which was filled with fruit juice.</p>
